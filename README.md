## Pythonic Monopoly

### Background

#### Harold's company has just started a new Real Estate Investment division to provide customers with a broader range of portfolio options. Harold was tasked with building a prototype dashboard. The real estate team wants to trial this initial offering with investment opportunities for the San Francisco market. If the new service is popular, then they can start to expand to other markets.
#### The goal of this dashboard is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in San Francisco.

#### Rental Analysis
#### The first step to building the dashboard is to work out all of the calculations and visualizations in an analysis notebook; then use it with Panel to create the final layout.

#### Housing Units Per Year
#### Use the rental_analysis.ipynb to calculate the number of housing units per year and visualize the results as a bar chart using the Pandas plot function.

#### Average Gross Rent in San Francisco Per Year.
#### Visualize the average gross rent per year to better understand the trends for rental income over time.

#### Average Sales Price Per Year.
#### Determine the average sales price per year to better understand the sales price of the rental property over time.

#### Average Prices By Neighborhood.
#### Compare the average prices by neighborhood.

#### Top 10 Most Expensive Neighborhoods.
#### Calculate the mean sale price for each neighborhood and then sort the values to obtain the top 10 most expensive neighborhoods on average.

#### Parallel Coordinates and Parallel Categories Analysis
#### Use plotly express to create parallel coordinates and parallel categories visualizations so that investors can interactively filter and explore various factors related to  #### the sales price of the neighborhoods.

#### Neighborhood Map.
#### Read in neighborhood location data and build an interactive map with the average prices per neighborhood. Use a scatter mapbox object from plotly express to create the visualization.

#### Dashboard.
#### Use the Panel library to build an interactive dashboard for all of the visualizations.
