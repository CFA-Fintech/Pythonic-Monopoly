## Pythonic Monopoly

### Background

#### Harold's company has just started a new Real Estate Investment division to provide customers with a broader range of portfolio options. Harold was tasked with building a prototype dashboard. The real estate team wants to trial this initial offering with investment opportunities for the San Francisco market. If the new service is popular, then they can start to expand to other markets.
#### The goal of this dashboard is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in San Francisco.

#### Rental Analysis
#### The first step to building the dashboard is to work out all of the calculations and visualizations in an analysis notebook; then use it with Panel to create the final layout.

#### Housing Units Per Year
#### Use the rental_analysis.ipynb to calculate the number of housing units per year and visualize the results as a bar chart using the Pandas plot function.
